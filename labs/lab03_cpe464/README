Lab 3: cclient & server

To run: 
    $ make all
    $ ./server 54321 > output.log &
    $ ./cclient 54321

Notes:
    + The user can use '^C' to exit the cclient
    + The user may also opt to type '%E' to exit, this will send a signal to the server to terminate as well.
    + The cclient will terminate if it tries to send a PDU and recieves 0 bytes after sending
