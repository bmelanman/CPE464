/*
 * USER LEVEL PACKET FORMAT
 * All PDUs start with a 2-byte length field in network order and then a flag value as discussed below.
 * These three bytes are referred to as the chat header.
 */

/*
 * 2: Sent from server back to cclient
 *  - Confirming a good handle
 *  - This is a positive response to flag = 1
 *  - Format: 3-byte chat-header
 *
 * 3: Sent from server back to cclient
 *  - This is an error response to a flag = 1
 *  - Error on initial packet (handle already exists)
 *  - When the cclient receives this it prints out an error message and terminates
 *  - Format: 3-byte chat-header
 *
 * 8: Client to server when the client is exiting
 *  - Client program cannot terminate until it receives a flag = 9 from the server.
 *  - Client should not block while it is waiting for the Flag = 9 response packet.
 *  - Client needs to process any incoming messages until the Flag = 9 response arrives.
 *  - Format: chat-header
 *
 * 9: Server to client
 *  - ACK the clients exit (flag = 8) packet
 *  - After receiving this, the client can terminate
 *  - Format: chat-header
 *
 * 10: Client to server
 *  - Client requesting the list of handles. (So %L command)
 *  - After sending the Flag = 10, client must continue processing any other messages that come in until the Flag = 11 message arrives.
 *  - Format: chat-header
 *
 * 13: Server to client
 *  - This packet tells the client the %L is finished.
 *  - Immediately follows the last [FLAG 12] packet
 *  - Format: chat-header

 * 1: Sent from cclient to server
 *  - Client initial packet to the server
 *  - cclient blocks until it receives a packet with Flag = 2 or Flag = 3
 *  - Format: 3-byte chat-header, then 1 byte handle length then the handle (no nulls/padding)
 *
 * 7: From server to cclient
 *  - Error packet, if a destination handle in a message/multicast packet (flag = 5 or flag = 6) does not exist.
 *  - You should send one Flag=7 packet for each handle in error (so if a message contains 4 destination handles
 *    and 2 of them are invalid the server will send back two different Flag=7 packets).
 *  - Format: chat-header then 1 byte handle length then handle of the destination client (the one not found on the
 *    server) as specified in the flag = 5 or flag = 6 message.
 *
 * 12: Server to client
 *  - Sent immediately following the [FLAG 11] packet.
 *  - Each [FLAG 12] packet contain one handles currently registered at the server.
 *  - There will be one [FLAG 12] packet per handle.
 *  - The handles are sent one right after the other.
 *  - The server will not send any other packets until all the handles have been sent.
 *    eg: [FLAG 12] chat-header, 1 byte handle len, handle, chat-header...
 *  - After the [FLAG 12] message header arrives, you will only receive the handle data ([FLAG 12] packets)
 *    until all handles have been sent.
 *  - No other message should be intertwined with sending the handles from the server to the client.
 *  - You do not need to process any STDIN input while processing the Flag = 12 messages.
 *  - Format: chat-header, then one handle in the format of: (1 byte handle length, then the handle) (no null/padding).
